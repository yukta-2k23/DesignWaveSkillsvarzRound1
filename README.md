#Café Website - SKILLSVARZ Hackathon Submission


Welcome to our Café Website- Purr & Pour, built with love and creativity as part of our participation in the SKILLSVARZ Hackathon. This website is designed for a unique, cozy café that blends the joys of coffee, books, and pets. It's a place where you can sip your favorite brew, read a good book, and enjoy the company of furry friends.

Features

1. Our Vibe
We created a special section called "Our Vibe", which introduces the three core elements of the café:
- Coffee & Comfort: The essence of the café, where guests can relax and enjoy delicious coffee.
- Pets & Paw-sitivity: A pet-friendly space where customers can interact with cute pets. We also introduced a "Pet of the Month" feature, where visitors can nominate their pets for a spotlight!
- Books & Brews: A peaceful area to read books while sipping on your favorite coffee.

2. Flippable Menu
The café's menu is designed to be interactive and engaging with a flippable digital menu, enhancing the user experience and mimicking the feel of browsing a physical menu.

3. Chat with Us (WhatsApp Integration)
For easy communication, we've added a "Chat with Us" feature. Customers can directly reach out through WhatsApp to inquire about the menu, book reservations, or ask questions.

4. Aesthetic Design
The website features a clean, aesthetic design that captures the warm, welcoming vibe of the café. It's made to be visually appealing and user-friendly, providing a seamless browsing experience across all devices.

Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design)
- JavaScript (for interactive elements like the flippable menu)
- Turn.js (for the flipbook-style menu)
